Nice to Have:
- Stones as their own layer
- Cluster/group items at the same (x, z) coordinates.
- Lore books as separate web page
- Update to 1.20 (new traders and trades, some blocks updated)

Issues/Todo:
- Uses base Minecraft names for items (ex: Emerald->Scale, Netherite->Celestial)
- Uses base Minecraft entity pictures
- Missing mini-bosses like Abbot Balthysar, Burnt Generals, whatever is in Insohm Coven of Potentia island
- Spelling might be wrong in some places
- Location descriptions might be wrong, they are just my best guess for nearby lore items and assumptions.
